# Shadow Dungeon Game
A simple dungeon crawler game built using the Bagel library.
Shadow Dungeon is an academic project developed as part of my Object-Oriented Design (OOD) coursework.
The project showcases principles of OOD including encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and design patterns, resulting in a well-structured and extensible codebase.

This project was awarded H1 Honours.
